# Runs automatically before `npm run dev` (see the "predev" npm script).
# Three jobs:
#   1. Free ports 8001 (backend) and 3001 (frontend) if a previous run left
#      a zombie process behind - this project has repeatedly hit "address
#      already in use" from stale uvicorn/next processes surviving a
#      terminal being closed instead of the app being stopped cleanly.
#   2. Kill any orphaned dev-stack process from a previous `npm run dev`
#      session - the ARQ worker, the backend, the frontend, AND the
#      scripts/dev.mjs orchestrator itself (see dev.mjs's own docstring for
#      the cmd.exe "Terminate batch job?" story that motivated it). Matched
#      by command line, not by port, because:
#        - the worker binds no port at all, so Free-Port above never
#          touches it;
#        - and even for the backend/frontend, killing *only* the process
#          that happens to hold the listening socket leaves every process
#          ABOVE it in the tree (the .venv shim, dev.mjs, the cmd.exe that
#          launched it, npm's own node process) still running - confirmed
#          in practice: stopping a dev session via something that kills
#          just the top-level tracked process (no cascading signal to
#          children at all, unlike a real terminal Ctrl+C) orphaned the
#          *entire* tree, not just the listening leaf. Since Python doesn't
#          hot-reload, any of these surviving is silently running whatever
#          OLD code was loaded when it started, out of sync with the
#          current source, and (for the worker) still polling the same
#          shared Redis queue the new session's worker also polls.
#   3. Make sure Redis is up on 6379, starting it detached if needed. Redis
#      is deliberately NOT managed by dev.mjs: it holds job-queue/checkpoint
#      state that must outlive individual dev sessions, so we only ever
#      start it here, never kill it here.
