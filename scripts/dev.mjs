/**
 * Replaces `concurrently` for `npm run dev`.
 *
 * Why this exists: on Windows, `concurrently` (and npm scripts in general)
 * run each sub-process through `cmd.exe /c`. Because these children share
 * the parent's console (that's how their output shows up inline), a Ctrl+C
 * or "stop" on the terminal delivers a Ctrl+C break to the ENTIRE console
 * process group at once - including all three nested cmd.exe wrappers. Each
 * one independently traps that as "did a batch script just get interrupted?"
 * and blocks on its own interactive "Terminate batch job (Y/N)?" prompt
 * instead of exiting. If that prompt isn't answered "Y" for literally every
 * single one (routine when the stop button kills the top-level process
 * instead of typing into the terminal), the real processes underneath -
 * uvicorn, the ARQ worker, next dev - never actually die. They keep running
 * as invisible orphans: still bound to their ports/still polling the same
 * Redis queue as the NEXT `npm run dev` session's fresh copies, and (since
 * Python doesn't hot-reload) still serving whatever OLD code was loaded
 * when they started. Confirmed repeatedly in practice - see predev.ps1's
 * Kill-OrphanedArqWorkers/Free-Port, which only exist to mop this up
 * *after the fact* on the next startup.
 *
 * The fix: never let cmd.exe (or any shell) sit in the middle at all. Every
 * child below is spawned with `shell: false`, invoking either a real .exe
 * directly (.venv's python) or `node <script.js>` directly (Next's own bin
 * script, bypassing the npm.cmd shim) - there is no batch-file context left
 * anywhere in the tree, so there is nothing to show that prompt. A native
 * Ctrl+C now hits every process in this console's group directly and each
 * one runs its own real (already-graceful) SIGINT handler - uvicorn/arq's
 * own "shutting down" logic, not a shell pretending to babysit it.
 *
 * As a backstop (in case something ignores SIGINT, e.g. a wedged network
 * call), this script's own SIGINT/SIGTERM handler force-kills each child's
 * entire process tree via `taskkill /T /F` - `/T` matters here because
 * `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` on this machine is itself a thin shim that
 * re-execs the real interpreter as a CHILD process; killing only the shim's
 * own pid would leak the real one.

// This project is a copy of PRODUCT - ML and runs side by side with it, so
// its two Python processes must be told apart from the original's:
//   - `-X agri_ml` is a no-op Python flag (just lands in sys._xoptions) that
//     shows up in the command line of both the .venv shim AND the real
//     interpreter it re-execs, so predev.ps1 can match ONLY this project's
//     processes by it.
//   - The module argument is deliberately placed after the options
//     (`uvicorn --host ... backend.main:app`, `arq --no-burst backend...`),
//     because the ORIGINAL project's predev.ps1 kills anything matching
//     `uvicorn\s+backend\.main:app` / `arq\s+backend\.workers\.arq_worker`
//     regardless of folder. `--no-burst` is arq's default behaviour anyway.
