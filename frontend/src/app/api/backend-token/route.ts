/**
 * Mints a short-lived HS256 JWT signed with the shared NEXTAUTH_SECRET so
 * the browser can call the FastAPI backend directly with
 * `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The backend verifies this token with
 * the same secret (see backend/auth/jwt_verify.py) — no database lookup
 * needed on the Auth.js side for every backend request.
 *
 * We deliberately use the low-level `getToken()` (reads + decrypts the
 * session cookie directly from this request) instead of the higher-level
 * `auth()` helper. `auth()` internally memoizes its result per request via
 * React's `cache()`, and in Auth.js v5 beta this memoization has observed
 * cross-request bleed under concurrent Route Handler calls in dev — the
 * exact same session cookie would randomly decode successfully or come
 * back empty from one call to the next. `getToken()` has no such cache: it
 * decodes straight from `request`'s cookies every time, so it can't be
 * polluted by a different in-flight request.
