ARQ worker process definition. Run with:

ARQ automatically retries the job (max_tries=3); the job engine's

    `job_run_lock:{id}` (see job_engine.py) is ALWAYS held, with a
    heartbeat-renewed short TTL, for the entire duration a real
    `JobEngine._run_locked()` is actively processing a job - so if a job's
    DB status is "RUNNING" but that lock doesn't exist, there is, with
    certainty, no live process anywhere actually working on it: either it
    already expired (the process died) or it never existed in this process's
    lifetime. Left alone, the UI shows that job as "RUNNING" forever with a
    Stop button that does nothing, because there's no live loop left to ever
    read the Redis control flag it sets.

    This only runs once per worker startup (not a background poller) - a
    fresh worker process is exactly the moment stale state from a previous,
    now-dead worker process needs to be swept up before anything new tries
