"""
Converts a company URL into LLM-ready markdown.

Fallback chain:
  1. Redis cache          — same URL never re-fetched within 7 days
  2. Jina Reader          — r.jina.ai/{url} -> clean markdown (headless Chrome render)
  3. Groq compound-beta   — visit_website built-in tool, Groq fetches server-side
  4. name_location        — caller falls back to name+location only (no markdown)

The LLM never scrapes with a custom parser — Jina Reader (or Groq's own
compound-beta tool) does the fetching + cleaning, and the resulting
markdown is simply placed inside the LLM prompt as context.
